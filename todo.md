# Bill Ramos' To-Do List

I passed all of the tests as provided, but there are a few things that I want to update/change. These functions have a few issues that would pop up in a production environment but I wanted to get the test back to you in a timely fashion. I'd like to take some time to address those issues post-deadline.

### To-Do
- ArrayTester.php
  - orderArrayComplex()
    - Create new function for complex ordering of arrays.
